# CS470-Final-Project

I really struggled with this project.  Specifically implementing k-fold cross validation and naive bayes.  I had to google a lot of different methods and techniques for training and testing the model before I had anything that remotely worked.  Because of this I unfortunately did not have time to implement the rest of this project.

As I am still relatively new to python I had to spend a significant amount of time just uploading the training data file.  Eventually I found a way to only have to upload it once per session which allowed me to debug the rest of the section quicker and much easier.  On top of this I had to do a lot of research for pandas to properly set up the dataset, removing the last few columns, splitting the data into testing and trainging sets as well as shuffling the dataset to provide the model with a better mix of samples.

My biggest issue came in the form of poor accuracy.  After the initial success of finally getting the program to run I was disheartened to see my accuracy was near 60%.  I feel like I tried everything to ensure the data being fed to the model was properly shuffled and split into training and testing sets along with their acoumpying results.  I'm still not sure where the Issue with this lies and I wish I could have figured it out before the due date.
